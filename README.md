# bucket_brigade_simulator

A simple simulator in the browser for the bucket brigade problem, where we can
evaluate the convergence behavior of bucket brigades with a slow-down pebble.

The simulator is hosted here [https://bucket-brigade-simulator.streamlit.app/](https://bucket-brigade-simulator.streamlit.app/) for a quick demo.

You can run the simulator locally by installing the dependencies in `requirements.txt` and running:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
